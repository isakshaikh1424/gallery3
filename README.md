***why i am waisting time for solving the issue for firebase auth for ios i have waisted 4 hours for fixing this . 
but from now if some things are not working i can go forward with next step and if possible after completion the step i will come back for 
resolving those issues***

### after removing the firebae auth also not working the ios with codemagic then i will remove the firebase from front end and use in backed \n fully 
### then only i will focus on only design and backend integration with firebase i will use firebase in backend itself
### now ios build is working fine without firebase. need to constrant on backend and ui design
